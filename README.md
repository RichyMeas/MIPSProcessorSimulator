# MIPSProcessorSimulator
Core part of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM using the C language. This demonstrates a few functions of a MIPS
processor. This project also utilizes the principle of datapth and control signals of a MIPS processor. This simulator 
reads in a file that has MIPS machine codes and simulates what the MIPS does cycle-by-cycle. In this project the MySPIM uses
a single-cycle datapath.
